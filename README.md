# Introduction
We try to find solutions to reduce food waste. In this domain, many researches are concerned with the allocation of the volunteers that collect the donated food or with optimizing the delivery of teh donated food. We try to solve the same problem from a different prespective, which is to reduce the amount of food wasted. In other words, we look for ways to limit food waste, so instead of this food going to waste, it can be donated. To achieve food waste reduction, we will try to minimize the food wasted at restaurants. Using a dataset for orders at a restaurant, we can predict the quantities needed for the ingredients. Instead of restaurants ordering bulks of ingredients, due to fear of their inability to serve their demand, and increasing the probability of the food being wasted, we will try to minimize the wasted food by predicting the quantities needed and ordering the ingredients according to the prediction. If the prediction was accurate enough, the amounts of wasted food should be at a minimum.
